# fortran-notes
My personal list of fortran LINKS, URL's, NOTES, FILES, etc i use to read up on mathematical functions and programs in fortran95 2003 standard

# why is this list on github?

for the past i believe 2-3 months ive been showing fortran programs, scripts, and its usages some people or actually quite a large amount of people in the offical scare_sec_hackers discord server, my instagram and github have been asking me for notes and usages about fortran, not just notes but people also asked me to teach them about fortrans main workings, syntax, future and past history / development, so, i decided to make a repo of all my personal notes of fortran95 and how fortran works, this will be a simple tutorial on how fortran works, the first part will be a in short explanation about fortran and its usages as well as references and links / urls that i was able to learn and understand fortran from, which actually today was a major help, 

# Why fortran?

Fortran as we all know is a language that was built during the 50's to be exact 1957 which was its public release, fortran95 while being a legacy programming language and easily replaceable with c, php, python, or GO is still a very very largly used language, this is due to its quite simple syntax and its easily understandable mathematical statements and symbols, when you first look at fortran code you may be quite suprised at how weird and wacky it is but the more you get into the language the more you will find out its not that horrid of a language, and that it is very very easy to understand given you are a programmer who specializes in fields around mathematics, engineering, or science since well thats kinda what fortran is mainly used for today. 

# Fortran simple functions and code style 

in order to first execute your own fortran program we should learn the basics of how fortran works and what file extensions go under it even compilers, so if you own a linux distribution you should have a compiler for fortran called `gfortran` this im sure you can get for windows also but im not exactly sure how it would work given i personally have not tried to write fortran on windows. to start writing our fortran program we need to initalize a file, the name of our first fortran program will be `main.f90` once you have saved that `depending on your IDE, OS, or ENV` you should see the icon change to something like as seen below
